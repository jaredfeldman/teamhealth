# Team Health Tool

This tool is used by teams to better understand subjective opinions on where they fall in [Westrum's Organizational Typology](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture).

The survey is based on research conducted by Ron Westrum and findings of the book [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) by Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim, which shows that [a Generative culture enables information processing through three mechanisms](https://itrevolution.com/westrums-organizational-model-in-tech-orgs/):
1. People collaborate more effectively and there is a higher level of trust;
2. Primary focus on the mission; and
3. Encourage a level playing field, where hierarchy plays less of a role than the Pathological or Bureaucratic alternatives.

The survey is worded in a way that emphasizes the characteristics of a Generative culture. The more that respondents reply in a positive manner (i.e. Slightly to Strongly Agree), the more that they feel their team is exhibiting the characteristics of a Generative culture.

The following table compares the three types of organization cultures outlined in Ron Westrum's research:
